## Introduction

This is a simple CRUD application for managing student records, implemented using Spring Boot. The application allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on student data and provides filtering and searching capabilities.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete student records.
- Filter students by various criteria (e.g., name, age, course).
- Search for specific students using a search box.
- User-friendly web interface for managing student data.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL database server
- Your favorite integrated development environment (IDE)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git
cd student-management-system
```

### Database Configuration

1. Create a MySQL database named `student_management`.
2. Update the database connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_management
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
```

### Build and Run

Build and run the application using Maven:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### Access the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

### CRUD Operations

1. **Create:** Click on the "Add Student" button and fill in the student details.
2. **Read:** View the list of students on the home page.
3. **Update:** Click on the "Edit" button next to a student's record to modify their information.
4. **Delete:** Click on the "Delete" button to remove a student from the database.

### Filter and Search

- Use the filters on the home page to filter students based on criteria such as name, age, and course.
- Use the search box to find specific students by name or other keywords.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Thymeleaf (for the web interface)
- MySQL (or your preferred database)
- Maven (for project management)
